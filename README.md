# Pentesting OWASP Juice Shop with LLMs

This is a repository intended to be a self-contained playground for testing the vulnerable web application [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/) with a combination of large language models (LLMs) and automated testing tools.

## Installation

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

to bring up

1. a Python `analysis` environment with a running jupyter notebook server on [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888), along with the [ChatGPT API](https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT) python interface. To get the link with validation token, run `docker-compose logs analysis`.
2. a running instance of [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/) running on [localhost:9993](http://localhost:9993).
3. a running instance of [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) running on [localhost:9090/zap/](http://localhost:9090/zap/)

Ports are configured in the [compose file](./docker-compose.yml) and can be changed as you see fit.

## ZAP reports

The [ZAP docker image comes with automated endpoint scans](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/docker/about/#packaged-scans) which generate reports. Once the environment is up, to do a baseline scan run:

```bash
docker-compose exec zap zap-baseline.py -t https://www.google.com -g ./reports/gen.conf -r ./reports/report.html -J ./reports/report.json
```
